<h3>Validating Forms</h3>
<p>
    Form validation is something you find on most websites where you either sign up for
    or create an account for. You will need to provide things such as emails or passwords.
    Form validation makes sure that the user inputs the right things in the right places.
    For example, if you are entering your email, you will always have a <i>@</i> and <i>.com</i>
    in the email.
</p>
<p>
    Below is an input box that will ask you for an email. Try entering something that is not an email.
    There's also a password with some requirements to meet. Try different things and hit <i>submit</i>
     to see what happens.
</p>
<form>
    <label for="email">Email:</label>
        <input id="email" type="email" name="email" placeholder="your email" required="email">
    <label for="Password">Password:</label>
        <input id="Password" type="password" name="Password" placeholder="your password" required="Password" pattern=".{5,10}" required title="5-10 Characters">
        <input type="submit" name="submit">
</form>
<p>
    HTML5 provides built-in form validation. That way, there's no need to use any Javascript
    in order to validate a form, at least for some things. You can include attributes on form elements in 
    your HTML to use validation. Some attributes are <i>required, minlength</i> and <i>maxlength, min</i>
    and <i>max, type</i> and <i>pattern.</i>
